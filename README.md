## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I practiced the use of CSS grid template areas.

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

```css
.proud-of-this-css {
	color: papayawhip;
	grid-template-column: repeaat(3, 1fr);
	grid-template-area:
		". team ."
		"supervisor team calculator"
		"supervisor karma calculator"
		". karma .";
	/* use dot to add empty space */
	/* there are three columns hence three items on each line */
}
```

### Useful resources

- [Net Naija's video on grid areas](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tPosqmwIx0w) -
  This helped me for understand and implement the grid areas.
